      "### Definitions and Concepts\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Manifold with Boundary:** \n",
      "   - A **manifold with boundary** is a space that locally looks like Euclidean space, except at the boundary. The boundary of a manifold is itself a manifold whose dimension is one less than that of the manifold.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Open Manifold:**\n",
      "   - An **open manifold** is a manifold without a boundary.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Boundary Closure:**\n",
      "   - A **boundary closure** \\(N\\) of an open manifold \\(M\\) is a compact manifold such that its interior is homeomorphic to \\(M\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Homeomorphism:** \n",
      "   - A **homeomorphism** is a continuous function between topological spaces that has a continuous inverse, indicating that two spaces are topologically the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cobordism:** \n",
      "   - A **cobordism** between \\(n\\)-dimensional manifolds \\(N\\) and \\(N'\\) is an \\((n+1)\\)-dimensional manifold whose boundary is the disjoint union of \\(N\\) and \\(N'\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cobordism Determined by a Homeomorphism\n",
      "\n",
      "Given:\n",
      "- Two boundary closures \\(N\\) and \\(N'\\) of an open manifold \\(M\\).\n",
      "- A homeomorphism \\(f: N^\\circ \\to (N')^\\circ\\) (between their interiors).\n",
      "- A locally flat isotopy inverse \\(j\\) of the inclusion of the interior \\(N^{\\circ} \\hookrightarrow N\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "The **cobordism determined by \\(f\\)** is constructed as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "- \\(W_f = N' \\setminus fj(N^{\\circ})\\): This is the manifold obtained from \\(N'\\) by removing the image under \\(fj\\) of the interior of \\(N\\). Effectively, you take \\(N'\\), \"cut out\" the portion corresponding to the interior of \\(N\\) as transformed by \\(f\\), yielding a new manifold.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- The cobordism is formalized by the triple \\((W_f, fj|_{\\partial{N}}, i_{\\partial{N'}})\\), where:\n",
      "  - \\(fj|_{\\partial{N}}\\) is the restriction of \\(fj\\) to the boundary of \\(N\\).\n",
      "  - \\(i_{\\partial{N'}}\\) is the inclusion of the boundary of \\(N'\\) into \\(N'\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Visualization and Understanding\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Conceptually,** this means \\(N\\) and \\(N'\\) are \"connected\" through a manifold \\(W_f\\), which contains the data of the transition as determined by the homeomorphism \\(f\\).\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Intuitively,** you can think of \\(W_f\\) as the \"negative space\" or remainder in \\(N'\\) once \\(fj(N^\\circ)\\) has been removed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Related Theorems\n",
      "\n",
      "The notes reference the **topological \\(h\\)-cobordism theorem** in higher dimensions (\\(\\dim(N) \\geq 5\\)), which has implications for how manifolds relate via homeomorphisms and cobordisms. In particular, it ensures that certain homeomorphisms are extendable over the entire manifold, not just on interiors, and provide conditions for constructing mapping tori.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Functoriality in Cobordism\n",
      "\n",
      "From context 3, there's an important aspect that cobordisms constructed from homeomorphic interiors can be composed. Namely, given a composition of homeomorphisms \\(g \\circ f\\), you find that the cobordism for this composition \\(W_{g\\circ f}\\) is isomorphic to the \"glued\" cobordisms \\(W_f\\) and \\(W_g\\), reflecting a sort of categorical composition or functoriality of cobordism.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "A cobordism determined by a homeomorphism between the interiors of compact manifolds with boundary is effectively a way to transition and relate these manifolds through a third intermediate manifold. This intermediate manifold embodies the change dictated by the homeomorphism, representing an equivalence or \"cobordism\" class that connects the boundaries of these manifolds.\n"
